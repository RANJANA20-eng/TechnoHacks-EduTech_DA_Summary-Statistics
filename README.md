# Introduction :
summary statistics are used to summarize a set of observations, in order to communicate the largest amount of information as simply as possible. Statisticians commonly try to describe the observations in

1. A measure of location, or central tendency, such as the arithmetic mean
2. A measure of statistical dispersion like the standard mean absolute deviation
3. A measure of the shape of the distribution like skewness or kurtosis
4. If more than one variable is measured, a measure of statistical dependence such as a correlation coefficient
